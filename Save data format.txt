The save data is stored twice for redundancy.
Each occurrence is 0x1000 bytes, so the entire save file is 0x2000 bytes.

000,01F: "AGBZELDA:THE MINISH CAP:ZELDA 5"
030,002: Save file 1 checksum.
  To get this value, calculate the checksums of the string at 034,004 and the data at 080,500. Add those two checksums together and mask with & 0xFFFF.
032,002: Save file 1 redundant checksum.
  This is just negative (030,002). Adding these two values together should produce 0x10000.
034,004: "3ZCM" for initialized save files, "INIT" for uninitialized. "DelF" for corrupted/deleted files?
040,004: Could be a checksum for save file 2?
044,004: "3ZCM" for initialized save files, "INIT" for uninitialized.
050,004: Could be a checksum for save file 2?
054,004: "3ZCM" for initialized save files, "INIT" for uninitialized.
080,500: Save file 1 data.
580,500: Save file 2 data.
A80,500: Save file 3 data.
  why are these 0x500 bytes instead of 0x4B4 bytes?
