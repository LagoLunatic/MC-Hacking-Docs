080A7C5C is where it stores the item ID of the smith's blade key item to entity+A
080A7C38 - function that gives a cutscene item?
08009C30,2 - has the item ID of the smith's blade
08009C2E appears to be a script command.

(List of script command functions at: 0811E524)
Script command types:
  01 - Marks the start of initialization - the part of the script that should be run while the room is being loaded in.
    Set bit &02 of bitfield 02033287,1.
  02 - Marks the end of initialization.
    Clear bit &02 of bitfield 02033287,1. (Might mark the end of initialization commands?)
  03 - Unconditional jump. Takes a single argument which is the offset to jump, relative to the argument (not the start of the command).
    Can be a negative offset to loop.
    Note that this offset is rounded to a halfword in case it's odd for some reason. (Rounded towards zero.)
  04 - Affirmative conditional jump.
    If cutscene entity+14,4 is nonzero it jumps, otherwise it does not.
  05 - Negative conditional jump.
    If cutscene entity+14,4 is zero it jumps, otherwise it does not.
    It seems like NPCs use this to loop when idle, and stop the loop when you talk to them in order to put a message onscreen...?
  06 - ??? conditional jump.
    If cutscene entity+4,4 is less than the length of the current script command in halfwords (from 02033286,1) it jumps, otherwise it does not?
  0B - Executes a function.
    Takes a single word argument, which is a pointer to the function to run.
    The func it calls gets passed the following arguments:
      r0 - The entity that started this cutscene (e.g. the NPC)
      r1 - The cutscene entity (e.g. 02036594)
  1A - Checks if the player owns at least a certain number of rupees.
    Takes a single halfword argument, the minimum number of rupees.
  1B - Checks if the player owns at least a certain number of mysterious shells.
    Takes a single halfword argument, the minimum number of shells.
  16 - Checks if the player is within a certain region.
    Takes three halfword arguments.
      arg0 - Center X pos
      arg1 - Center Y pos
      arg2 - Bitfield.
        & 00FF - Half width (on either side of the center)
        & FF00 - Half height (above or below the center)
  2D - Sets a global flag.
    Takes a halfword argument which is the index of the bit.
  4E - Sets an extra argument for the next command to use.
    Takes a single word argument, the extra argument to set.
  5C - Shows dialogue message?
    Takes two halfword arguments.
    The first is the message ID.
    The second is ???.
  61 - Sets the direction this entity is facing.
    Sets entity+14,1 to the command argument.
  63 - ? Animation related?
    Sets entity+14,1 to something calculated by some function
    Sets animation index offset?
    This might calculate what the correct anim index should be for the current direction the NPC is facing
  79 - Sets a bit in the cutscene entity?
    the bitfield is located at r1+8,4
    The command argment is the index of the bit.
  7A - duplicate of 79?
  82 - Give an item.
    Takes a single argument which is the item ID.
    If the item ID is 3F (mysterious shells) the number of shells to give needs to be set as an extra argument.
    To do that call script command 4E before calling this command.
  83 - Give a kinstone piece.
    Takes a single argument which is the kinstone piece ID to give.
  84 - Checks if an item is owned.
    Takes one argument, the item ID.
  85 - Sets an item as owned, without an item get cutscene.
    Takes two arguments, the item ID and the bits to set for it in the owned item bitfield.
